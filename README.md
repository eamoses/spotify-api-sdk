# Spotify client side OAuth API with web playback SDK

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Integrate both the user log in functionality and web playback

### Log in to Spotify and your most recent song / playlist will start playing in your browser. Controls on the UI will allow you to pause, play, go back or go forward one song.

### There are no refresh tokens with the Spotify Web Playback SDK, so every time your browser is refreshed you have to log back in to Spotify.
